# Task 6: Implement Queues and Jobs for the Bookstore Application

## Objective

The goal of this task is to set up a Laravel queue system and create a job that processes a task asynchronously. In this case, the job will send a notification (e.g., an email) when a new book is added to the bookstore.

## Instructions

1. **Queue Setup:**
   - Configure Laravel's queue system using the `database` driver. Make sure to set up the necessary database tables for the queue.
   - Update your `.env` file to configure the queue settings (e.g., `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`).

2. **Create a Job:**
   - Create a job that sends a notification (e.g., an email) when a new book is added to the database.
   - The notification could contain details like the bookâ€™s title, author, and publication date.

3. **Dispatch the Job:**
   - Modify the `store()` method in your book management controller so that the job is dispatched whenever a new book is successfully created.

4. **Run the Queue Worker:**
   - Start a queue worker to process the jobs asynchronously.

5. **Test the Queue:**
   - Test the job by adding a new book to the bookstore and ensuring that the notification is sent.
   - Check the queue and the job's status to confirm that it is being processed asynchronously.

6. **Commit Your Work:**
   - Once you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message (e.g., `Implemented job for sending notifications when a new book is added`).

7. **(Optional) Push to GitHub:**
   - If you are working remotely and choose to push your code, ensure that your repository is private and that access is granted to the evaluators.

## Deliverables

- A queue system set up using Laravel's `database` driver.
- A job that sends a notification when a new book is added.
- The job properly dispatched from the `store()` method.
- Queue worker tested by adding a new book and verifying the notification.
- Commit your work with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional) Push your code to a private GitHub repository with access granted to the evaluators.

Once you've completed this task, you're ready to move on to Task 7!
