# Task 7: Write Unit and Feature Tests for the Bookstore Application

## Objective

The goal of this task is to write unit and feature tests for the bookstore application, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the application's functionality.

## Instructions

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Write unit tests for the `Book` model to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Test the validation rules, relationships (if any), and any custom methods defined in the model.

2. **Feature Tests:**
   - Write feature tests for the following functionalities:
     - **Book Management:** Test the creation, updating, and deletion of books through the controller.
     - **Authentication:** Ensure that unauthenticated users cannot manage books (create, edit, delete) and that authenticated users can.
     - **Middleware:** Test that only `admin` users can access book management routes.
     - **API:** Write tests for the API endpoints to ensure the correct data is returned and the API functions as expected (create, read, update, delete).

3. **Mocking and Factories:**
   - Use Laravel’s model factories to generate test data for the `Book` model.
   - Mock any external services (e.g., email notifications) when testing the queue and job functionalities.

4. **Running Tests:**
   - Use Laravel’s testing tools (PHPUnit) to run your tests and ensure all tests pass.

5. **Commit Your Work:**
   - Once you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message (e.g., `Added unit and feature tests for bookstore application`).

6. **(Optional) Push to GitHub:**
   - If you are working remotely and choose to push your code, ensure that your repository is private and that access is granted to the evaluators.

## Deliverables

- Unit tests written for the `Book` model.
- Feature tests written for book management, authentication, middleware, and the API.
- Tests executed and passing with Laravel’s PHPUnit.
- Commit your work with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional) Push your code to a private GitHub repository with access granted to the evaluators.

Once you've completed this task, your bookstore application should be fully tested and ready for submission!
