# Task 11: Consume an External API (e.g., Book Metadata or Weather)

## Objective

The goal of this task is to consume an external API to retrieve additional data for the bookstore application (e.g., pulling book metadata or real-time weather updates for the bookstore location).

## Instructions

1. **Choose an API:**
   - Select a relevant external API, such as:
     - Google Books API to automatically fetch book metadata (e.g., title, author, description).
     - A weather API to display real-time weather updates for the bookstore location.

2. **Make API Requests:**
   - Implement functionality to send API requests from the bookstore application using Laravelâ€™s `Http` facade or Guzzle.
   - Parse the API response and use it to populate or display additional data in the application, such as:
     - Automatically fetching book details when adding a new book.
     - Displaying weather updates on the homepage or a specific page.

3. **Handle API Responses:**
   - Ensure proper error handling for failed API requests. Display appropriate messages or fallback data when API requests fail.

4. **Display API Data:**
   - Integrate the retrieved data into the relevant sections of your application.
   - For example, pre-fill book information fields with data from the API or display weather information on the homepage.

5. **Testing:**
   - Test the integration by making API requests and displaying the fetched data in the bookstore application.
   - Ensure that the API calls are handled properly and that the data is displayed as expected.

6. **Commit Your Work:**
   - Once you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message (e.g., `Integrated external API for book metadata`).

7. **(Optional) Push to GitHub:**
   - If you are working remotely and choose to push your code, ensure that your repository is private and that access is granted to the evaluators.

## Deliverables

- External API integrated to fetch book metadata or weather information.
- Proper handling of API responses and error cases.
- API data displayed or used appropriately within the application.
- Commit your work with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional) Push your code to a private GitHub repository with access granted to the evaluators.

Once you've completed this task, you're ready to move on to Task 12!
