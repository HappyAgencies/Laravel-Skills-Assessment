# Task 15: Implement WebSockets for Real-Time Updates

## Objective

The goal of this task is to use Laravel Echo and WebSockets to add real-time updates to the bookstore application, such as notifications when a new book is added.

## Instructions

1. **Install Laravel Echo and WebSockets:**
   - Set up Laravel Echo and a WebSocket service (e.g., Pusher or a self-hosted WebSocket server).
   - Configure Laravel to use the chosen WebSocket service for broadcasting events.

2. **Broadcast New Book Event:**
   - Create an event that is triggered whenever a new book is added to the bookstore.
   - Broadcast this event using WebSockets so that connected clients receive real-time updates without refreshing the page.

3. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Integrate Laravel Echo on the frontend to listen for the `NewBookAdded` event.
   - Display a real-time notification or update the book list when a new book is added, without requiring a page refresh.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the real-time updates by adding new books and ensuring that notifications or live updates are displayed for connected users.
   - Ensure the WebSocket connection is stable and handles multiple simultaneous connections properly.

5. **Commit Your Work:**
   - Once you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message (e.g., `Implemented real-time updates using WebSockets`).

6. **(Optional) Push to GitHub:**
   - If you are working remotely and choose to push your code, ensure that your repository is private and that access is granted to the evaluators.

## Deliverables

- WebSockets set up using Laravel Echo and a WebSocket service (e.g., Pusher).
- Real-time notifications or updates when a new book is added.
- Frontend integration to handle real-time events without page refreshes.
- Commit your work with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional) Push your code to a private GitHub repository with access granted to the evaluators.

Once you've completed this task, your real-time functionality should be fully implemented and ready for evaluation!
