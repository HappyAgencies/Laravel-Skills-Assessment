# Task 8: Implement Search and Pagination for Books

## Objective

The goal of this task is to add search functionality and pagination to the bookstore application, allowing users to easily find and browse books.

## Instructions

1. **Search Feature:**
   - Add a search bar to the book listing page.
   - Allow users to search for books by title, author, or any other relevant attribute.
   - Implement the search functionality using query parameters to filter the book list.

2. **Pagination:**
   - Add pagination to the book listing page to display a limited number of books per page.
   - Ensure the pagination works seamlessly with the search feature, preserving search query results across pages.

3. **Testing:**
   - Test the search feature by entering various queries and ensuring accurate results are displayed.
   - Test the pagination to verify that the correct number of books is displayed per page and that navigation between pages works as expected.
   - Ensure that search results are properly paginated.

4. **Commit Your Work:**
   - Once you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message (e.g., `Added search and pagination for books`).

5. **(Optional) Push to GitHub:**
   - If you are working remotely and choose to push your code, ensure that your repository is private and that access is granted to the evaluators.

## Deliverables

- A fully functional search feature for books.
- Pagination on the book listing page.
- Both features tested to ensure correct behavior.
- Commit your work with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional) Push your code to a private GitHub repository with access granted to the evaluators.
