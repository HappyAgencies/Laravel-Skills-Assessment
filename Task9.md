# Task 9: Implement File Uploads for Book Covers

## Objective

The goal of this task is to implement a file upload feature that allows users to upload and display book cover images when adding or editing books.

## Instructions

1. **File Upload in Form:**
   - Modify the book creation and editing forms to allow users to upload a book cover image.
   - Ensure the form accepts only image files (e.g., `jpg`, `png`).

2. **Handle File Upload:**
   - Modify the controller to handle the uploaded image file when a new book is created or an existing book is updated.
   - Store the uploaded images in the `storage/app/public/covers` directory and ensure proper file naming conventions.

3. **Image Display:**
   - Ensure that the uploaded book cover image is displayed on the book listing and detail pages.
   - Verify that the images are accessible via the browser by linking to the public storage path.

4. **Validation:**
   - Implement validation rules to ensure that only image files are accepted and that the file size is reasonable (e.g., max 2MB).

5. **Testing:**
   - Test the file upload functionality by adding and editing books with cover images.
   - Ensure the images are correctly stored and displayed in the application.

6. **Commit Your Work:**
   - Once you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message (e.g., `Implemented file upload for book covers`).

7. **(Optional) Push to GitHub:**
   - If you are working remotely and choose to push your code, ensure that your repository is private and that access is granted to the evaluators.

## Deliverables

- File upload functionality for book cover images.
- Uploaded images stored and displayed correctly on the book pages.
- Image validation implemented for file type and size.
- Commit your work with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional) Push your code to a private GitHub repository with access granted to the evaluators.

Once you've completed this task, you're ready to move on to Task 10!
